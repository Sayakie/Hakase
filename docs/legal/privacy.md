### Location of your Data
Hakase is based in South Korea. Your data is stored in our servers located in South Korea. No matter where you are located, you consent to the processing and transferring of your information in South Korea.

### Third Party Links and Content
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by us (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.

### Ownership of your Data
The content generated and/or submited to our Service belongs to their respective owners listed in the appropriate sections of the Site, where the content is shown publicly.

By submiting your content in our Service as stated in our Terms of Service, you grant the rights to our agents, handling legal and copyright inquiries, to act on your behalf and request the deletion of any illegal copy of the Information stored by third-party services.

This process ONLY begins once an email is issued to our legal team from the respective owners of the Content, with a statement mentioning explicitely that their Information is listed by Third Party Sites without their Consent. You can contact our legal team by emailing us at [Hakase@Discord Support Server](https://discord.gg/mCNVD9WgNQ). Owners may be invited to complete some additional steps to verify their identity.

### Data Retention and Deletion
The user content submitted within our services such as contents ("Discord Message") are immediately deleted once Our bot detects it. The retention does not vary depending of the individual issuing the deletion.

If the user generated a template with our Application without submitting it on the Site, the data reliable to the Guild is immediately deleted once the user removes it from the Guild.

Your content may be deleted at any time by our moderation team or by website administrators if they notice any violation of our [Terms of Service](./terms.md).

In that case, we generally retain personal data for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes identified herein. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup for additional time.

### Security
Team dareharu takes all reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free.

Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected on the Service in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage on our systems.

While we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party individuals from illegally obtaining access to this information. We do not warrant or represent that your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Changes to this Policy
The contents of this statement may be altered at any time, at our discretion. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
